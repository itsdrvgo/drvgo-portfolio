                            Canceling an ongoing project with DRVGO results in
                            receiving a strike.

                        <li>
                            Strikes are recorded to ensure fair and reliable

                        <li>
                            For each strike, a 10% fee will be applied to the
                            total price of your next order.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you have accumulated strikes, one strike will be
                            deducted for every 10% fee paid.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For example, if you have 1 strike and pay a 10% fee
                            on your new order, your strike count will be reduced
                            to 0.
