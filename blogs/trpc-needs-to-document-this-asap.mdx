## Introduction

I've been using <Link href="https://trpc.io">tRPC</Link> for a while now and I love it. It's a great way to handle API calls in a Next.js project. It's easy to use and it's easy to set up. But there's one thing that I've been struggling with for a while now. And that is the documentation. It's not that the documentation is bad, it's just that it's not complete. There are a lot of things that are not documented. And that's what I'm going to talk about in this article.

## The problem

Even thought it's been more than a year since Next.JS App Router update was introduced, the tRPC documentation still doesn't mention it. And that's a problem. Because if you want to use tRPC in your Next.js project and you want to use the <Highlight content="app" /> directory, you're going to have a hard time. There's a specific section for setting up with Next.JS in tRPC documentation, but it was written for <Highlight content="pages" /> router. <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/client/nextjs">Here's the link</Link>.

So, if you want to use the <Highlight content="app" /> directory, you're going to have to figure it out yourself. And that's what I did. I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. And I finally did. So, I'm going to share it with you.

## The solution

### File Structure

```
---
name: Project Structure
language: bash
---
src
├── app
│   ├── api
│   │   └── trpc
│   │       └── [trpc]
│   │           └── route.ts
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── layout.tsx
├── components
│   └── providers
│       └── client.tsx
└── lib
    ├── drizzle
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   └── schema.ts
    ├── trpc
    │   ├── routers
    │   │   └── post.ts
    │   ├── client.ts
    │   ├── context.ts
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   └── trpc.ts
    └── utils.ts
```

### Pre-requisites

-   If you already have a Next.js project, you can skip this step. But if you don't, you can follow along. First, let's create a new Next.js project. Just run the following command in your terminal. We'll use <Link href="https://pnpm.io/">pnpm</Link> as our package manager.

    ```
    ---
    name: Terminal
    language: bash
    ---
    bunx create-next-app
    ```

-   Now that the project is setup, let's install the dependencies we need. Just run the following command in your terminal.

    ```
    ---
    name: Terminal
    language: bash
    ---
    bun add @tanstack/react-query @trpc/client @trpc/next @trpc/react-query @trpc/server superjson
    ```

-   We also need a dev dependency for this. So, run the following command in your terminal.

    ```
    ---
    name: Terminal
    language: bash
    ---
    bun add -D @tanstack/react-query-devtools
    ```

-   **(Optional)** We'll be setting up tRPC with <Link href="https://orm.drizzle.team/">Drizzle</Link> with <Link href="https://postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</Link>. The setup process is well documented in the <Link href="https://orm.drizzle.team/">Drizzle Documentation</Link>. So, I won't be going over it in this article. But if you want to follow along, you can check out their documentation.

> If you're using tRPC v10, make sure you install <Highlight content="4.36.1" /> version of <Highlight content="@tanstack/react-query" /> and <Highlight content="@tanstack/react-query-devtools" />. If you want to use v5 of React Query, you need to install v11-beta of tRPC. We'll be using v10 in this article.

### Process of setting up tRPC

Now that we have all the dependencies installed, let's set up tRPC. First, create a new folder called <Highlight content="lib" /> inside your <Highlight content="src" /> folder. If you are not using <Highlight content="src" /> folder, you can create the <Highlight content="lib" /> folder in the root directory.

Inside this <Highlight content="lib" /> folder, let's create the files and folders we need.

#### Setting up the Database

-   As we'll be using <Highlight content="Drizzle" />, I already have a schema setup for it. You can create your own schema, or just copy-paste this one. Just create a new folder called <Highlight content="drizzle" /> inside the <Highlight content="lib" /> folder and create a file called <Highlight content="schema.ts" /> inside it. And paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/drizzle/schema.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { InferInsertModel, InferSelectModel } from "drizzle-orm";
    import { pgTable, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
    import { createInsertSchema, createSelectSchema } from "drizzle-zod";
    import { generateId } from "../utils"; // uses @paralleldrive/cuid2"

    // SCHEMAS

    export const posts = pgTable("test__posts", {
        id: text("id")
            .notNull()
            .unique()
            .primaryKey()
            .$defaultFn(() => generateId()),
        content: text("content").notNull(),
        createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
            .notNull()
            .defaultNow(),
    });

    // TYPES

    export type Post = InferSelectModel<typeof posts>;
    export type NewPost = InferInsertModel<typeof posts>;

    // ZOD SCHEMA

    export const insertPostSchema = createInsertSchema(posts);
    export const selectPostSchema = createSelectSchema(posts);
    ```

-   We also need to access the <Highlight content="db" />, so create a file called <Highlight content="index.ts" /> inside the <Highlight content="drizzle" /> folder and paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/drizzle/index.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { env } from "@/env.mjs"; // uses @t3-oss/env-nextjs
    import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
    import postgres from "postgres";
    import * as Schema from "./schema";

    const connection = postgres(env.DATABASE_URL, {
        prepare: false,
    });

    export const db = drizzle(connection, { schema: Schema });
    ```

#### Setting up the tRPC Server

-   Now that we've the database setup, let's setup the tRPC server. Create a folder called <Highlight content="trpc" /> inside the <Highlight content="lib" /> folder and create a file called <Highlight content="context.ts" /> inside it. And paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/context.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { inferAsyncReturnType } from "@trpc/server";
    import { db } from "../drizzle"; // importing the db from drizzle
    import { posts } from "../drizzle/schema"; // importing the posts table from drizzle

    export const createContextInner = () => {
        // now we'll have access to the db and the posts table in the context in our tRPC server
        // we won't need to import the db and the posts separately in our routes
        return {
            db,
            posts,
        };
    };

    export const createContext = () => {
        return createContextInner();
    };

    // we'll use this type in our routes to get the type of the context, make it type-safe
    export type Context = inferAsyncReturnType<typeof createContextInner>;
    ```

    You can read more about what <Highlight content="Context" /> is in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/server/context">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

-   Now, we can initiate writing our tRPC router code. Create a file called <Highlight content="trpc.ts" /> inside the <Highlight content="trpc" /> folder and paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/trpc.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server";
    import superjson from "superjson";
    import { ZodError } from "zod";
    import { Context } from "./context"; // importing the context we created earlier

    // creating the tRPC router
    // passing the type 'Context' as generic to the initTRPC.context() function
    // so that we can get the type of the context in our routes
    export const t = initTRPC.context<Context>().create({
        transformer: superjson,
        errorFormatter({ shape, error }) {
            return {
                ...shape,
                data: {
                    ...shape.data,
                    zodError:
                        error.cause instanceof ZodError
                            ? error.cause.flatten()
                            : null,
                },
            };
        },
    });

    // exporting the router
    export const createTRPCRouter = t.router;
    // exporting the procedure
    export const publicProcedure = t.procedure;
    ```

-   If you have any authentication layer or you want to use any middleware in your routes, you can have something like this,

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/trpc.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { TRPCError } from "@trpc/server";
    // ...previous code

    const isAuth = t.middleware(async ({ ctx, next }) => {
        if (!ctx.auth?.userId)
            throw new TRPCError({
            code: "UNAUTHORIZED",
            message: "You're not authenticated!",
        });

        return next({
            ctx: { ...ctx, auth: ctx.auth },
        });
    });

    // ...previous code
    export const protectedProcedure = t.procedure.use(isAuth);
    ```

    Now, all routes with the <Highlight content="protectedProcedure" /> procedure will be protected by the <Highlight content="isAuth" /> middleware. You can read more about middleware in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/server/middleware">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

-   That's all we needed to do before we can create a route. So, let's go and create one. Create a folder called <Highlight content="routers" /> and create a file called <Highlight content="post.ts" /> inside it. Now, paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/routers/post.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    // lib/trpc/routers/post.ts
    // importing the router and the procedure we created earlier
    import { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure } from "../trpc";

    export const postRouter = createTRPCRouter({
        // we'll use this name in our client to call this route
        getPosts: publicProcedure
            .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
                const { db, posts } = ctx;

                // getting all the posts from the database
                const data = await db.query.posts.findMany();
                return { data };
            }),
    });
    ```

    You can add more routes if you want. All you need to do is add more procedures to the router. You can read more about procedures in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/server/procedures">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

-   Now, we need to link this route to our server. So, create a file called <Highlight content="index.ts" /> inside the <Highlight content="trpc" /> folder and paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/index.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { postRouter } from "./routers/post"; // importing the post router
    import { createTRPCRouter } from "./trpc"; // importing the router

    export const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({
        posts: postRouter, // linking the post router to the server
    });

    // exporting the type of the router that we'll use in our client
    export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;
    ```

    You can have merged routers if you want. You can read more about merged routers in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/server/merging-routers">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

-   Lastly, we need to create a caller for the client, by which we'll send or receive data from the server. Create a file called <Highlight content="client.ts" /> inside the <Highlight content="trpc" /> folder and paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: lib/trpc/client.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { createTRPCReact } from "@trpc/react-query";
    import { AppRouter } from "."; // importing the type of appRouter

    // this is what we'll use in our client to call the routes
    export const trpc = createTRPCReact<AppRouter>();
    ```

    You can read more about the client in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/client/react">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

#### Setting up the Next.js App

-   Now that we have the server setup, let's setup our Next.JS app, so that we can handle our tRPC calls through native <Highlight content="API Routes" />. Create a folder called <Highlight content="api" /> inside the <Highlight content="src" /> folder and create a folder called <Highlight content="trpc" /> inside it. This folder will contain a dynamic route with the name of the procedure we want to call. So, let's create a folder called <Highlight content="[trpc]" />, and lastly this folder will have our <Highlight content="route.ts" /> file. Check out [File Structure](#file-structure) for more info.

-   Now, inside the <Highlight content="route.ts" /> file, paste the following code.

    ```
    ---
    name: src/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts
    language: ts
    ---
    import { appRouter } from "@/src/lib/trpc"; // importing the appRouter
    import { createContext } from "@/src/lib/trpc/context"; // importing the createContext function
    import { fetchRequestHandler } from "@trpc/server/adapters/fetch";
    import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

    // this is the handler that we'll use in our API route
    const handler = (req: NextRequest) => {
        return fetchRequestHandler({
            // passing the request
            req,
            // the endpoint where we'll send the request
            endpoint: "/api/trpc",
            // passing the router
            router: appRouter,
            // passing the createContext function
            createContext,
            // if there's an error, we'll log it in the console
            onError:
                process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
                    ? ({ path, error }) => {
                        console.error(
                            `❌ tRPC failed on ${path ?? "<no-path>"}: ${
                                error.message
                            }`
                        );
                    }
                    : undefined,
        });
    };

    // exporting the handler so that next.js can recognize it
    export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
    ```

    Even though tRPC provides a built-in Next.JS adapter, we can still use the native <Highlight content="fetch" /> adapter. You can read more about it in the <Link href="https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/fetch">tRPC Documentation</Link>.

-   We're almost at the end. Now, we need to wrap the body using a tRPC Provider. So, let's do it quickly! Go inside your <Highlight content="Components" /> folder, and create a folder called <Highlight content="providers" /> inside it. Now, create a file called <Highlight content="client.tsx" /> inside it and paste the following code in it.

    ```
    ---
    name: src/components/providers/client.tsx
    language: tsx
    ---
    // IMPORTANT: make sure this is marked as a client component
    "use client";

    import { ReactNode } from "react";
    import { trpc } from "@/src/lib/trpc/client";
    import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
    import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";
    import { httpBatchLink, loggerLink } from "@trpc/react-query";
    import { useState } from "react";
    import superjson from "superjson";

    // getting the base url
    const getBaseUrl = () => {
        if (typeof window !== "undefined") return "";

        // VERCEL_URL is an environment variable that is set by Vercel
        // if we're in production, we'll use the VERCEL_URL
        if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;

        // if we're in development, we'll use localhost
        return `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`;
    };

    function ClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        const [queryClient] = useState(() => new QueryClient());

        const [trpcClient] = useState(() =>
            trpc.createClient({
                transformer: superjson,
                links: [
                    httpBatchLink({
                        url: `${getBaseUrl()}/api/trpc`,
                    }),
                    loggerLink({
                        enabled: (opts) =>
                            process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ||
                            (opts.direction === "down" &&
                                opts.result instanceof Error),
                    }),
                ],
            })
        );

        return (
            // wrapping the body using the tRPC Provider
            <trpc.Provider client={trpcClient} queryClient={queryClient}>
                <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
                    {children}
                <ReactQueryDevtools />
                </QueryClientProvider>
            </trpc.Provider>
        );
    }

    export default ClientProvider;
    ```

-   Final Step, go to your <Highlight content="layout.tsx" /> file and wrap the body using the <Highlight content="ClientProvider" /> component we just created.

    ```
    ---
    name: src/app/layout.tsx
    language: tsx
    ---
    import { ReactNode } from "react";
    import ClientProvider from "@/src/components/providers/client";

    function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
        return (
            <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
                <head />
                <ClientProvider>
                    <body>{children}</body>
                </ClientProvider>
            </html>
        );
    }

    export default RootLayout;
    ```

### Using tRPC in the client

Let's create a page where we can use tRPC. Create a file called <Highlight content="page.tsx" /> inside the <Highlight content="app" /> folder and paste the following code in it.

```
---
name: src/app/page.tsx
language: tsx
---
"use client";

import { trpc } from "@/src/lib/trpc/client";

function Page() {
    // calling the route we created earlier
    const { data, isLoading } = trpc.posts.getPosts.useQuery();

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Posts</h1>

            {isLoading && <p>Loading...</p>}

            {data?.data.map((post) => (
                <div key={post.id}>
                    <p>{post.content}</p>
                    <p>{post.createdAt}</p>
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}

export default Page;
```
