## Introduction

At this point, we all know that <Link href="https://orm.drizzle.team">Drizzle</Link> is a great ORM for interacting with SQL databases. However, one of the most common questions I get is how to paginate responses in Drizzle. The fact is, Drizzle natively doesn't support pagination, so when I was asked this question, I had to think of a solution. I surfed the web and found out that some of the others were also having the same problem. So, I ran into <Link href="https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/1041">this issue</Link> on Drizzle's GitHub Repo.

Seemed like, there were two packages that could help me with this problem. One was <Link href="https://github.com/xantiagoma/drizzle-cursor">drizzle-cursor</Link> and the other was <Link href="https://github.com/miketromba/drizzle-pagination">drizzle-pagination</Link>. I tried both of them, and <Highlight content="drizzle-pagination" /> seemed to be the best fit for my use case. So, I decided to use it in my project. In this article, I'll show you how to use <Highlight content="drizzle-pagination" /> to paginate responses in Drizzle.

## What is Pagination?

Before we get started, let's first understand what pagination is. Pagination is a technique for dividing a long list of items into segments or pages. This is done to improve the performance of the application. For example, if you have a list of 1000 items, you can divide it into 10 pages of 100 items each. This way, you can load only the first page when the user opens the application. Then, when the user sends a request for the second page, you can load the second page and so on.

## Why do we need Pagination?

The best way to understand why we need pagination is to look at an example. Let's say you're using Twitter. You open the application and you see a list of tweets. You scroll down and you see more tweets. You scroll down again and you see more of them, and so on. Now, as a rough estimation, let's say Twitter has a total of 10 million tweets. If you load all of them at once, it'll take a lot of time, and more over you have to do 10 million row-reads at once. This will not only slow down the application, but also increase the cost of the database.

So, what we can do is, we can divide the tweets into pages. For example, we can divide them into 100 tweets per page. This way, when the user opens the application, we can load only the first page. Then, when the user scrolls down, we can load the second page and so on. This way, we can reduce the load on the database and improve the performance of the application.

### File Structure

```

## Pre-requisites

If you're reading this article, we can safely assume that you've a Next.JS project setup. If not, run the following command to create a new Next.JS project.

```
---
name: Terminal
language: bash
---
bunx create-next-app
```

Once you've created the project, install the following dependencies.

```
---
name: Terminal
language: bash
---
bun add drizzle-orm drizzle-pagination drizzle-zod postgres
```

Also, as we'll be making the infinite-query calls from the client-side, we'll be using <Highlight content="tRPC" />. You can use native <Highlight content="Fetch API" /> or <Highlight content="Axios" /> as well. But, I prefer <Highlight content="tRPC" /> as it's easy to use and has a lot of features. If you don't know how to setup tRPC, read my previous article on <Link href="/blog/trpc-needs-to-document-this-asap">tRPC needs to document this ASAP!</Link>. Once you've setup tRPC, install the following dependencies.

```
---
name: Terminal
language: bash
---
bun add @mantine/hooks @paralleldrive/cuid2
```

## Setting up the Database

Now, let's setup the database. For this tutorial, we'll be using <Highlight content="PostgreSQL" />. We'll using <Link href="https://supabase.com">Supabase</Link> as our database provider. Get the <Highlight content="DATABASE_URL" /> from your Supabase project and add it to your <Highlight content=".env.local" /> file.

```
---
name: .env.local
language: bash
---
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
```

### Connecting to the Database

Now, if you're having a <Highlight content="src" /> folder in your project, create a <Highlight content="lib" /> folder inside it. Inside the <Highlight content="lib" /> folder, create a <Highlight content="drizzle" /> folder. Inside the <Highlight content="drizzle" /> folder, create a <Highlight content="index.ts" /> file. Inside the <Highlight content="index.ts" /> file, add the following code.

```
---
name: src/lib/drizzle/index.ts
language: ts
---
import { env } from "@/env.mjs";
import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/postgres-js";
import postgres from "postgres";
import * as Schema from "./schema";

const connection = postgres(env.DATABASE_URL, {
    prepare: false,
});

export const db = drizzle(connection, { schema: Schema });
```

### Creating the Schema

Now, let's create the schema. Inside the <Highlight content="drizzle" /> folder, create a <Highlight content="schema.ts" /> file. Inside the <Highlight content="schema.ts" /> file, add the following code.

```
---
name: src/lib/drizzle/schema.ts
language: ts
---
import { InferInsertModel, InferSelectModel } from "drizzle-orm";
import { pgTable, text, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";
import { createInsertSchema, createSelectSchema } from "drizzle-zod";
import { generateId } from "../utils"; // we'll create this file later

// SCHEMAS

export const posts = pgTable("test__posts", {
    id: text("id")
        .notNull()
        .unique()
        .primaryKey()
        .$defaultFn(() => generateId()),
    content: text("content").notNull(),
    createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
        .notNull()
        .defaultNow(),
});

// TYPES

export type Post = InferSelectModel<typeof posts>;
export type NewPost = InferInsertModel<typeof posts>;

// ZOD SCHEMA

export const insertPostSchema = createInsertSchema(posts);
export const selectPostSchema = createSelectSchema(posts);
```

### Creating the Utils

Now, let's create the <Highlight content="utils" /> file. Inside the <Highlight content="lib" /> folder, create a <Highlight content="utils.ts" /> file. Inside the <Highlight content="utils.ts" /> file, add the following code.

```
---
name: src/lib/utils.ts
language: ts
---
import { init } from "@paralleldrive/cuid2";

// generate a unique id of length 16
export const generateId = init({
    length: 16,
});
```

## Setting up Post Route

Now, let's setup the post route from where we'll be fetching the posts. If you're using <Highlight content="tRPC" />, go inside your <Highlight content="routers" /> folders, and create a <Highlight content="post.ts" /> file. Inside the <Highlight content="post.ts" /> file, add the following code.

```
---
name: src/lib/trpc/routers/post.ts
language: ts
---
// the package that we'll be using to paginate responses
import { withCursorPagination } from "drizzle-pagination";
import { z } from "zod";
import { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure } from "../trpc";

// creating the post router
export const postRouter = createTRPCRouter({
    // the name of the router
    getInfinitePosts: publicProcedure
        .input(
            z.object({
                // Cursor: The cursor from where to start fetching the posts.
                // This will progressively increase as we fetch more posts.
                cursor: z.string().nullish(),
                // Limit: The number of posts to fetch. The default value is 5.
                limit: z.number().min(1).max(50).default(5),
            })
        )
        .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
            const { db, posts } = ctx;
            // de-strucutre the input
            const { cursor, limit } = input;

            const data = await db.query.posts.findMany(
                // use the withCursorPagination function to paginate the responses
                // read more about it here: https://github.com/miketromba/drizzle-pagination
                withCursorPagination({
                    limit,
                    cursors: [
                        [
                            // by which column to sort the posts
                            posts.createdAt,
                            // in which order we should sort, "asc" or "desc"
                            "desc",
                            // the cursor from where to start fetching the posts
                            cursor ? new Date(cursor) : undefined,
                        ],
                        // ... add more cursors here
                        // for example, updatedAt, id, etc.
                    ],
                })
            );

            return {
                // return the data
                data,
                // return the next cursor
                nextCursor: data.length
                    ? data[data.length - 1].createdAt.toISOString()
                    : null,
            };
        }),
});
```

Currently we're not using any filters, but you can add them as per your use case. You can also add more cursors. For example, if we were to get all posts of a specific user, we would write something like this.

```
---
name: src/lib/trpc/routers/post.ts
language: ts
---
import { eq } from "drizzle-orm";
// ... other imports

// ... previous code
getInfinitePosts: publicProcedure
    .input(
        z.object({
            // ... previous input
            // UserId: The id of the user whose posts we want to fetch.
            userId: z.string(),
        })
    )
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
        const { db, posts } = ctx;
        // de-strucutre the input
        const { cursor, limit, userId } = input;

        const data = await db.query.posts.findMany(
            // use the withCursorPagination function to paginate the responses
            // read more about it here: https://github.com/miketromba/drizzle-pagination
            withCursorPagination({
                where: eq(posts.authorId, userId),
                // ... other filters
            })
        );

        return {
            // return the data of posts for that user
            data,
            // return the next cursor
            nextCursor: data.length
                ? data[data.length - 1].createdAt.toISOString()
                : null,
        };
    }),
```

## Setting up the Client

Now, let's setup the client. We can call the <Highlight content="getInfinitePosts" /> procedure from any component we want. For this tutorial, we'll be calling it from the <Highlight content="app/page.tsx" /> file. As we'll be calling this from browser, make sure you mark the page as <Highlight content="use client" /> at the top.

```
---
name: src/app/page.tsx
language: ts
---
"use client";

import PostCard from "@/src/components/posts/post-card"; // a custom component to display the posts
import Loader from "@/src/components/ui/loader"; // a custom component to display the loader
import { trpc } from "@/src/lib/trpc/client";
import { useIntersection } from "@mantine/hooks"; // a hook that we'll be using to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page
import { Divider, Spinner } from "@nextui-org/react";
import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef } from "react";

function Page() {
    const {
        data: postsRaw,
        isLoading,
        fetchNextPage,
        isFetchingNextPage,
    // fetching the posts from the route
    } = trpc.posts.getInfinitePosts.useInfiniteQuery(
        // the input - empty because we don't need any
        {},
        {
            // the cursor from where to start fetching the posts
            getNextPageParam: (lastPage) => lastPage.nextCursor,
        }
    );

    // a ref to the viewport
    const viewportRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
    // a ref to the last post element
    const { entry, ref } = useIntersection({
        root: viewportRef.current,
        threshold: 1,
    });

    useEffect(() => {
        // if the user reaches the bottom of the page, and there are more posts to fetch, fetch them
        if (
            entry?.isIntersecting &&
            postsRaw?.pages.length &&
            postsRaw?.pages[postsRaw.pages.length - 1].nextCursor
        )
            fetchNextPage();
        // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
    }, [entry]);

    // memoize the posts, so that they don't get re-rendered on every re-render
    const posts = useMemo(
        () => postsRaw?.pages.flatMap((page) => page.data) ?? [],
        [postsRaw]
    );

    return (
        <section className="flex justify-center p-5">
            <div className="w-full max-w-2xl space-y-4">
                {isLoading ? (
                    // if we're still fetching the initial posts, display the loader
                    <div className="flex justify-center">
                        <Loader />
                    </div>
                ) : !!posts.length ? (
                    // if there are posts to show, display them
                    <>
                        {posts.map((post, i) => (
                            <>
                                {i === posts.length - 1 ? (
                                    <div
                                        ref={ref}
                                        key={post.id}
                                        className="cursor-pointer"
                                    >
                                        <PostCard post={post} />
                                    </div>
                                ) : (
                                    <div

                                        <PostCard post={post} />
                                    </div>
                                )}

                                <Divider />
                            </>
                        ))}

                        // if we're fetching the next page, display the loader after the last post
                        {isFetchingNextPage && (
                            <div className="flex justify-center">
                                <Spinner />
                            </div>
                        )}

                        // if there are no more posts to fetch, display a message
                        {!isFetchingNextPage &&
                            postsRaw?.pages.length &&
                            !postsRaw.pages[postsRaw.pages.length - 1]
                                .nextCursor && (
